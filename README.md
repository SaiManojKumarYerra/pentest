# Penetration Tesing

**1. What is Penetration Testing?**
> Penetration testing (or pen testing) is a security exercise where a cyber-security expert attempts to find and
exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system. The purpose of this simulated attack is to identify any weak spots in a system’s defenses which attackers could take advantage of.
This is like a bank hiring someone to dress as a burglar and try to break into their building and gain access to the vault. If the ‘burglar’ succeeds and gets into the bank or the vault, the bank will gain valuable information on how they need to tighten their security measures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It should be performed only on own applications. Do not perform the Pen Testing on any application, unless you are authorized

**2. Main 3 approaches to Pen Testing**
> **1. White-box Penetration Testing** : Here testers have full knowledge of the system and full access to the system. This approach allows more in-depth testing.

> **2. Black-box Penetration Testing** : Here testers has no knowledge of the inner workings of the system. A tester would design the pen tests as an uninformed cyber attacker. This approach is the most similar to real-life scenarios, as hacker do not have the access to the source code of the application

> **3. Grey-box Penetration Testing**  : Here testers have limited knowledge of the system

**3.  Types of Penetration Testing?**
> 1. Web Application Penetration Testing
> 2. Client-side Penetration Testing
> 3. Network Penetration Testing
> 4. Social Engineering Penetration Testing
> 5. Physical Penetration Testing
> 6. Wireless Penetration Testing

**Web Application Penetration Testing**
> It is usually more targeted and more detailed than other types of pen tests. The main purpose is to find weaknesses and cybersecurity risks in websites and their components, such as their databases, source code, or the back-end network. Web application pen testing is particularly important now when a great increase in cybercrime.
